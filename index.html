								<span class="image main"><img src="images/coverPhoto.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Chop chop, slice slice, smash smash. A few years ago, those were the sounds that I was constantly hearing. Back then, those sounds were what I expected to be hearing every working day for the rest of my life. Today, I could not work in a more different setting, behind a computer screen, typing away with my fingertips.</p>
								<p>As a former chef, I loved cooking dishes. I loved, and still do love, the creativity and detail that goes behind making technical, beautiful and of course tasty dishes. Food is such an integral part of our lives, and can have such a positive and touching effect on people (just talk to my wife when she's hangry). But I wanted more. Something different, something that I felt could impact society and those around me just a little more.</p>
								<p>Then it happened. That magical moment. My genie came in the form of Professor Maloney, who taught the first programming class I ever took at my local community college. After that first class, it was like she had sprinkled some pixie dust on me; I knew I had found a new passion and future career. Programming was something that gave me the opportunity to continue to feed my love of problem solving and creativity, but in a position that had the potential to transform the entire structure of our society. This is what drives me now, the potential to affect and change the lives of people around me, and around the entire world.</p>
